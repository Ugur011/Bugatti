                        The Bugatti Veyron was the supercar that marked the return of Buggatti as a manufacturer, <br>
                        now beloning to the Volkswagen Group and becoming the halo car of the entire <br>
                        automobile group by using the most advanced solutions of the moment. The Veyron was a <br>
                        revolution in the automotive industry, taking performance far beyond what brand such as <br>
                        Ferrari, Lamborghini or Porsche had proposed at that time.

                <p>Within six months of Volkwagen’s acquisition, Bugatti flexed its muscles at the 1998 Paris Motor Show with the first of three show cars.
                     The Giugiaro-penned EB118, a coupe inspired by the legendary teardrop Bugatti Type 50 and 57SC Atlantic models, housed a W-18 engine that was essentially a trio of 60-degree V-6s. 
                     The EB118 wouldn’t set the stage for Bugatti’s styling direction as much as it would showcase its permanent all-wheel-drive platform. 
                     A sedan show car followed the next spring at the Geneva show, again with W-18 power.

                <h1>ENGINE</h1>
                <p>Power output is an astounding 1,001 horsepower and 922 foot-pounds of torque that can vault the Veyron from a standstill to 60 mph in a mind-boggling 2.47 seconds. At Volkwagen’s test track, one of the few stretches of pavement capable of safely handling such a high-performance car, the Veyron topped 253 mph. Top Gear presenter James May verified the Veyron’s otherworldly acceleration on camera, and noted that reaching 253 mph rather than the car’s “normal” 213 mph top speed is an event at every step.</p>

                <p>Bugatti's interiors are timeless and beautiful, made with expensive materials most other manufacturers wouldn’t dare touch. An owner of a multi-million dollar supercar will expect no less when they step in for a drive.

                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>But there’s a catch: there are no screens (apart from the instrument cluster ones) in a Bugatti interior, not even on the center stack. Bugatti's drivers will have their eyes fixed on the road, admiring their hypercar’s performance, instead of catching a movie or playing a game on a long drive!
